HTML 5 weather app that works based on a users current location. Uses the [YR.NO](http://www.yr.no/) weather service and shares it code base with a small [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hourlyweather&hl=en) that has similiar functionality.

## Current Status
Migrated to Heroku after Google App Engine deprecated the Master/Slave Datastore, project is in maintenece status and I dropped support for city weather linking.

Migrated from Heroku when their free plans changed and now it can be seen in a static version to preserve it [here](https://www.davidhampgonsalves.com/hourweather/).
